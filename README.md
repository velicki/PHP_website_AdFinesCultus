# WHAT I HAVE LEARNED!


While coding the Ad Fines Cultus NGO website, I gained valuable insights and learned several important concepts and skills in web development. Here's what I learned:

1. PHP Programming: Developing the backend logic and server-side scripting using PHP enabled me to understand the fundamentals of server-side programming. I learned how to handle HTTP requests, process form data, interact with databases, and dynamically generate HTML content.

2. Database Management with MySQL: Working with MySQL databases allowed me to learn about database design, querying data, and managing database operations efficiently. I gained experience in creating database tables, defining relationships between tables, and executing SQL queries to retrieve and manipulate data.

3. HTML Structure and Semantics: Structuring the website's content using HTML provided me with a solid foundation in web markup. I learned how to create well-organized and semantically meaningful HTML documents, defining the structure of web pages and organizing content into headings, paragraphs, lists, and other HTML elements.

4. CSS Styling: Utilizing CSS for styling the website's layout and design enhanced my understanding of front-end development. I learned how to apply styles, colors, fonts, and layout techniques to create visually appealing and responsive web interfaces. Additionally, I gained insights into CSS frameworks and best practices for maintaining clean and modular CSS code.

5. JavaScript Interactivity: Implementing JavaScript for client-side scripting enabled me to add interactive features and enhance the website's functionality. I learned how to use JavaScript to handle user events, manipulate the DOM (Document Object Model), validate form inputs, and create dynamic content dynamically.

6. User Experience Design: Designing a user-friendly and intuitive interface for the NGO website helped me understand the importance of user experience (UX) design. I learned how to prioritize usability, accessibility, and readability to create a positive experience for website visitors.

Overall, coding the Ad Fines Cultus NGO website was a valuable learning experience that enhanced my skills in web development, database management, user interface design, and project collaboration. It provided me with practical insights into building functional and visually appealing websites while contributing to a meaningful cause.
